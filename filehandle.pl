# Filehandle is the name in a Perl program for an I/O connection between your Perl process and the outside world. That is it's the name of a connection,
# not necessarily the name of a file. Perl has mechanisms to connect a filehandle to almost any-thing.
# Before perl 5.6 all filehandle names where barewords, and Perl 5.6 added the ability to store a filehandle reference in a normal scalar variable.
